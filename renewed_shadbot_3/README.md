The third generation of shadbots.

This time, the major difference is automatic scoreboard packet discovery. After one scoreboard packet from tag mode, the code will automatically learn the packet's structure and be able to parse new scoreboards afterwards, saving time every week manually doing that.

The rest of the code is similar or the same as `../renewed_shadbot_2`, so that it out of there.
