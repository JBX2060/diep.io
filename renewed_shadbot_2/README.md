The second version of Renewed Sh√§dbot features the following updates over the first version:

1. Improved speed of finding scoreboards up to 5 times
2. Tweaks to commands
3. New command - `go find`

# Installation

You need to compile `decompressor.cpp` and `pow_solver.cpp` into usable native node.js modules. You do it the following way:

1. Download the files
2. Execute `npm install -g node-gyp`
3. Execute `node-gyp configure` (you might need `sudo` too)
4. Execute `node-gyp build`
5. Put your bot's token in `config` file
6. After first launch of the bot, it will generate a new value in the `config` file called `hash`. Copy it whole, then send in the bot's DMs, to become it's owner. Keep the hash secret. You will be able to use it later on if you change accounts without restarting the bot.
7. See [this](https://github.com/supahero1/diep.io/tree/master/working-with-diep) to make basic diep.io commands work for the current update.

Now everything should work. Don't forget you need to launch `dworker.js` and `worker.js` before `bot.js`, or else the bot will quit, since it detected the necessary services are not available.
